# Social Media Dashboard (TweetDeck)

## Project Overview
This project aims to replicate the core functionality and user interface of a social media dashboard, similar to TweetDeck. Trainees will build a web application that aggregates and displays content from a simulated social media feed. The dashboard will feature multiple columns, each representing a different feed (e.g., "Home," "Mentions," "Search," "Lists"). This project will assess trainees' ability to build a complex, responsive, and interactive frontend application using industry-standard technologies.

## Description
The Social Media Dashboard will provide a multi-column interface for users to view and interact with simulated social media content. The application will fetch data from a JSON-based API (simulated) and display it in real-time-updating columns. Users will be able to perform basic actions like viewing posts, filtering content, and potentially "liking" or "retweeting" (simulated). The focus is on frontend development, so backend functionality will be simulated using static data and basic JavaScript logic.

## Project Goals
- Develop a responsive, multi-column social media dashboard using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6+), and React.
- Implement data fetching and rendering using React components and state management.
- Create a user-friendly interface that mimics the core features of a social media dashboard.
- Demonstrate proficiency in building complex frontend applications with a focus on maintainability and scalability.
- Deploy the project on Netlify or Vercel and submit it on GitHub.

## Features & Functionalities

### Multi-Column Layout
- Implement a flexible and responsive layout that allows users to view multiple feeds simultaneously.
- Use Bootstrap's grid system or a similar approach to create the column structure.
- Columns should be resizable (optional, but a great addition).

### Simulated Social Media Feeds
- Create a JSON-based API (static data) to simulate social media posts.
- Include fields like:
  - id (unique identifier)
  - user (username and profile picture)
  - content (text of the post)
  - timestamp (date and time of the post)
  - likes (number of likes)
  - retweets (number of retweets)
  - category (e.g., "Home," "Mentions," "Search," "Lists")
- Implement data fetching using fetch or axios (simulated).
- Implement initial data load and simulated new posts being added to the feed.

### Column Customization
- Allow users to add or remove columns.
- Allow users to configure the content of each column (e.g., select a specific feed).
- Implement a visual way to reorder the columns.

### Real-Time Updates (Simulated)
- Simulate real-time updates by periodically fetching new data from the API (using setInterval or a similar approach).
- Update the displayed content without a full page reload.
- Implement a smooth transition of the new posts.

### Filtering and Searching
- Implement a search bar to filter posts based on keywords.
- Allow users to filter posts by category (e.g., "Home," "Mentions").

### Basic Post Interactions (Simulated)
- Implement "like" and "retweet" buttons for each post.
- Update the like and retweet counts in the UI (without actual backend interaction).
- Implement visual feedback when a user interacts with a post.

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the dashboard is responsive across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use media queries and Bootstrap's responsive utilities.

### User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- Design a clean and intuitive user interface.
- Focus on usability and accessibility.
- Use consistent styling and branding.
- Implement loading states when data is being fetched.

### React Implementation
- Use React components for building the UI.
- Manage state using React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
- Implement data fetching and rendering using component lifecycles.
- Create reusable components.

### Fully Responsive Design
- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Uses Bootstrap Grid & CSS media queries.

## Deployment
- Project will be hosted on Netlify/Vercel.
- The GitHub repository will be shared for review.
